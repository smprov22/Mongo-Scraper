This is a news scraper app created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, and Mongo.

When the user hits the "/scrape" route, the newest headlines from the NYT Movie sections are returned to the page.  The user sees the article Headline, a brief summary of the summary, the author of the article, and a link to the article.  The user can also click on any article to leave a comment on it.  If the user clicks on the same article again, they can update or delete the comment.
